# Graph Theory Intro

A graph data structure consists of a finite , *and possibly mutable*, set of ordered pairs, called edges or arcs, of certain entities called nodes or vertices. A graph is represented by a pair of two sets (V , E)
where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges

<!--TL;DR a graph is formed by vertices and edges connecting the vertices -->

+ ### A Vertex (node)
    Represented as a little circle.
    + A `Degree` denotes how many edges are connected to a node
    + A `Loop` is an edge that points to the vertex itself
    +


+ ### An Edge (arc)
    Represented as a line connecting nodes.
